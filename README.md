# 📝 Text Generator using BART (Hugging Face Transformers)

This project demonstrates a simple and effective implementation of a **text generator** using the **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)** model from Hugging Face. The model generates coherent and context-aware text based on a given input prompt.

## 🚀 Features:

- Utilizes `facebook/bart-large-cnn` for summarization or generation tasks
- Supports custom input for inference
- Easy to run in a Jupyter Notebook environment

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries:

- Python
- Transformers (by Hugging Face)
- PyTorch

## 📦 Installation:

Install the required libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
